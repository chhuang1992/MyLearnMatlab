Hi, do you want to jump-start machine learning this Easter break?

I recommend Master Machine Learning Algorithms

This new Ebook teaches you 10 top machine learning algorithms step-by-step.
You will finally get past the math and start understanding algorithms.

It also includes spreadsheets that show you exactly how each step is calculated.
There's nowhere for the details to hide. You see it all.

Preeti Pandhu said it was an "amazingly simple machine learning book"

Take a look right now.

Put the chocolate aside and make some progress in machine learning this Easter.

PS. Any questions at all, please ask. I'm here to help.
